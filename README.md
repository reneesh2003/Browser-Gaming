# Mini-Project

GAMING WEBSITE :

    This projects aims to develop a website with a collection of internet web browser based game application.
    
Games engage the player for a long time and improve cognitive skills. This web based game application is divided into two sections. First section contains all the websites for the sign up of a new user and storing the details in the database, then the login page with user authentication which redirects to the home page on successful authentication. Second Section contains all the games which are present and you will be able to access the games using the links provided in the home page. The home page also contains a table which displays the statistics like last played time for each game, a contact us section and a section to make comments or reviews about the website which will be stored in the database for further use. Various web platform games are available on the internet, and my project is also inspired from them. We have chosen few popular games to begin my website. We have tried to keep the user interface simple and easy to understand as one has not to go many steps to play and win in the game.
